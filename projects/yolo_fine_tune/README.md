# Fine-Tuning YOLO Animation with Manim (Generated by GPT)

This project demonstrates how to create an animation explaining the fine-tuning process of YOLO models using the Manim library.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.9 or later is installed on your system.
2. **Virtual Environment**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the script:

### Step 1: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install Manim
pip install manim
```

### Step 3: Place the Script and Assets

1. Save the script file (e.g., `fine_tuning_yolo.py`) in your project directory.
2. Place your custom image (e.g., `yolo_detection_example.png`) in the same directory as the script.

### Step 4: Run the Script

To render and preview the animation, run the following command:

```bash
manim -pql fine_tuning_yolo.py FineTuningYOLO
```

- `-pql` ensures **preview** (`p`), **quality** (`q`), and **low-resolution** (`l`) rendering.
- Replace `FineTuningYOLO` with the class name in the script if it changes.

## Notes

- The rendered animation will appear in a new preview window by default.
- Output video files will be saved in the `media` directory created in your project folder.
